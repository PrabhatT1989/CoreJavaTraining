what is class?

class is a combination of Methods/variable , Object and Constructor

if anything is missing we cant execute our pgm


class A
{

//varible/method and constructor , object

sysout(
}

what is object?


Object is a replica of class - it is a blue print of class



WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver() //run time polymorphism/constructor //MOL/OR /Inheritance/class and object


Assignment :- create 4 class and each class should contains 3 method
all method should call inside into psvm 

one jave file


12.5+12.5


WHAT IS INHERITANCE ?

aquaring the properties from the parent class - that is inheritance
we can achieve with the help of extends keyword in java



what is multilevel inheritance

step by step inheritance or Generation by generation transformation is called a Multilevel inheritance



what is multiple inheritance

one class want to inherit more than one class at a time - multiple inheritance


can we achieve multiple inheritance in java

No , we cant achieve multiple inheritance at class level but we can achieve at interface level

Interface part will discuss later


what is the major difference of multiple and multilevel inheritance




what is single inheritance --- is simple inheritance -- extends 


what is many to one inheritance


what is one to many inheritance-- Multiple inheritance - interface level

Assignment :- Currency - 

which country you will create a object that currency should print - 

with the help of inheritance

India a= new India()
a.

Method Overloading - Same Methods but different signature/parameter/data type is called a
Method Overloading

We can achieve at single class only - no need to use inheritance

Data Type

10 20 30 --- by default it is integer

int- whole number --  medium Range
long -- whole number --- high Range
short-- whole number ---- less than integer but higher than byte
byte -- whole number -- very less

double -- decimal value --- high range
float -- decimal value---- Low range


blooean -- true /false

Char -- 'a'

String - String is not a Data type - it is class 
that part will discuss at String Concept - we will use like a Data Type -- "<Anything>"
